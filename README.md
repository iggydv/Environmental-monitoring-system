The purpose of this project was to design and test an Environment Monitoring System that tracks a number of environmental
conditions.

The monitoring system provides accurate real-time measurements of:
* temperature
* humidity
* air pressure
* wind speed
* date and time

It also allows human and computer interaction via a simple 5 button keypad, LCD, 
buzzer-alarm and UART communication. 
These measurements and interactions, are made possible by intricate circuitry 
and C-code
